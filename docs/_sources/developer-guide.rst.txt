How Engage Works
----------------

Architecture Diagram
---------------------

This Engage web application is built on top of Django, PostgreSQL, Celery and Redis. The diagram below shows 
the architecture.

.. image:: resources/engage-architecture.png

This Django application uses PostgreSQL as the database, and Celery Redis as the message broker for asynchronously 
running Engage models outside the HTTP request-response cycle. In Celery cluster, there are two kinds of workers - 
short-running task worker and long-running task worker.

Database Schema
---------------

The chart below shows the database schema.

Here also provides download of the schema in pdf and pptx formats,

* PDF: :download:`Database_Schema.pdf <resources/Database_Schema.pdf>`
* PPT: :download:`Database_Schema.pptx <resources/Database_Schema.pptx>`

Django Apps
-----------

Django `app` describes a Python package that provides some set of features. There are three apps created 
in this Engage web application.

* ``client``: A combination of views, templates, static files, URLs for interacting with users in frontend.
* ``api``: A combination of models, views, tasks and util functions for managing user files, building and running models in backend.
* ``taskmeta``: A combination of models, signals for recording Celery task status and failure traceback.

Please refer to the source code for details.

Unit Test
---------
Django provides a test framework that builds on the Python standard `unittest` library, with a small hierarchy. 
Based on API methods and tools privided by Django test framework, this application develops unit tests for 
HTTP-level request handling, model queries, and template rendering, etc.

There are two main apps need to run unit test - ``api`` and ``client``. How to run unit tests under Django test 
framework? Please make your docker-compose is up, and run the command line below:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker-compose exec app bash
    $ python manage.py test api client

It is essential of making sure that your code is safe to release after making changes, and cost-effective to maintain.

Django Celery
-------------

Celery, a popular distributed task queue, is applied in this project and used for running Engage models. 
The Celery worker is running in a separate container.

Celery Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, there are 3 types of Celery task in this project,

* ``upload_ts``: Create and upload user's timeseries csv file, where ``SoftTimeLimit=3540``, ``TimeLimit=3600`` seconds.
* ``build_model``: Build Engage model with inputs, where ``SoftTimeLimit=3540``, ``TimeLimit=3600`` seconds.
* ``run_model``: Run optmization for model using specified solver, where ``SoftTimeLimit=243600-180``, ``TimeLimit=243600`` seconds.

What would happen if task got timeout?

* The ``SoftTimeLimit`` should be less than ``TimeLimit``, it'd leave some time to clean up the task before killing the worker process.
* If ``SoftTimeLimit`` reached, it would raise a ``SoftTimeLimitExceeded()`` error, then task failed.
* After ``SoftTimeLimit``, when ``TimeLimit`` reached, system would kill the current worker process and start a new one.

Celery Flower
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Flower <http://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is a web based tool for monitoring and administrating Celery workers.
The link below is the address of Flower dashboard for dev.

http://0.0.0.0:5555

To protect your Flower instance from unwarranted access, it's recommend to setup authentication for access Flower dashboard.

For example, to use ``--basic_auth`` option when starting flower, 

.. code-block:: bash

    celery flower -A calliope_app --port=5555 --basic_auth=$FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH

Please do not setup this environment variable below:

.. code-block:: bash

    FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH=your-username:your-password

For more information, please refer to https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auth.htm.

Email Notification
------------------
This web application supports AWS SES and sends email notification to user after Engage model got a long run (longer than 20 mins). 

To enable this feature, please set the following environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    AWS_SES_REGION_NAME=
    AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT=
    AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL=

Please notice that, this feature is optional, and has no effect to model run if not AWS SES setup.

Timeseries Data
---------------

You may need sample timeseries data for development, please checkout them here - 
`sample timeseries data <https://github.com/NREL/engage/docs/resources/calliope-063/sampe-timeseries-data/>`_.


Calliope References
-------------------

Official Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This web application is built on top of ``Calliope - v0.6.6`` for now, the official documentation is linked here 
https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.6-post1/.


Example Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example models at national and urban scale can be find here - 
`example models <https://github.com/NREL/engage/docs/resources/calliope-063/example_models/>`_.


Commandlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The followings are some commands related to Calliope calls.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Generate Sample Model Files
    $ calliope new urban_scale --template=urban_scale

    # Model Run
    $ calliope run inputs/model.yaml --save_csv=outputs â€”-save_logs=logs --save_plots=plots


Python APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are examples of Calliope calls via IPython.

.. code-block:: Python

    >>> # Model Run
    >>> import calliope
    >>> model = calliope.Model('model.yaml')
    >>> model.run()
    >>> model.plot.flows() # Sample visualization
