Getting Started
===============

This page is about how to setup Engage development environment on machine. Docker provides a 
way to run applications securely isolated in containers packaged with all dependencies and libraries.
We use Docker in this project. In the following sections, we'll focus on how to setup development
environment using Docker.

Before step into environment setup, please make sure `Docker` and `Docker Compose` are 
installed. If not, please follow the official documentation for installation.

* Docker: Please refer to `Docker Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.
* Docker Compose: Please refer to `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_.

Fork Project 
------------

Please fork this project to your own account on GitHub, and then clone it from there.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/{your-account}/engage.git

Environment Variables
---------------------

Create a folder ``.envs`` in the root directory of project, then within ``.envs`` create a file 
``.local`` with following environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Django
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=YN3ZBsDH8r7r0QBjWc7nSmGqU5Cr0tMHdLufTQNl

    # PostgreSQL
    POSTGRES_HOST=calliope-postgres
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

    # Celery
    CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

    # Mapbox
    MAPBOX_TOKEN=

    # NREL PVWatts & PySAM API
    NREL_API_EMAIL=
    NREL_API_KEY=

# `MapBox <https://www.mapbox.com/>`_ is used to render interactive maps throughout the application's user interface. 
Must obtain a mapbox token for accessing the Mapbox basemap resources.To obtain a `Mapbox Token`, 
please refer to `get-started-tokens-api <https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/>`_.

# PVWatts is used to import PV solar capacity factor timeseries in the Locations tab of the user interface. 
Must obtain a PVWatts token for accessing the PVWatts API resources. 
To obtain a ``NREL_API_KEY``, please refer to NRREL's `api-key <https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/api-key/>`_.

The following environment variables about `AWS SES` are optional.

.. code-block:: bash

    # AWS SES (Optional)
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    AWS_SES_REGION_NAME=
    AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT=
    AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL=

Build Images
------------

Make sure you're on the root directory of the project, then run:

.. code-block:: 

    $ docker-compose build

Go to grap a drink, it'll take a few minutes to build the related images.

Start Services
--------------
After the images are built, to start docker container services and run in background,

.. code-block::

    $ docker-compose up --detach

Setup Database
--------------

Execute the ``app`` service, and enter the docker container.

.. code-block::

    $ docker-compose up --detach
    $ docker-compose exec app bash

Next, we need to migreate django models, create a superuser and load sample data into database.

* Migrate Django Models

.. code-block::

    python manage.py migrate

* Create a Superuser

.. code-block::

    python manage.py createsuperuser

* Load Admin Data

.. code-block::

    python3 manage.py loaddata --app api \
      admin_run_parameter.json \
      admin_parameter.json \
      admin_abstract_tech.json \
      admin_abstract_tech_param.json

* Load Sample Model (Optional)

.. code-block::

    python3 manage.py loaddata --app api \
      sample_model.json \
      sample_location.json \
      sample_technology.json \
      sample_tech_param.json \
      sample_loc_tech.json \
      sample_loc_tech_param.json \
      sample_timeseries_meta.json \
      sample_scenario.json \
      sample_scenario_loc_tech.json \
      sample_scenario_param.json

Web Server
----------
The development web server in docker is running on port 8000 at the IP address 0.0.0.0,
please visit: http://0.0.0.0:8000

If you want to bring container services to front with live logs on terminal, please run

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up

Done! Now, the docker development environment gets setup successfully, you can get start the 
development of Engage.
