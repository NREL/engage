A Calliope Web Environment for Collaborative Energy Systems Modeling and Planning

Engage is a free, open-access energy system planning tool that allows multiple 
users/stakeholders to develop and collaborate on capacity expansion models. 
The tool, developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), provides 
a collaborative and easy-to-use interface built on Calliope, a multi-scale energy 
systems modeling framework.

Please visit the NREL hosted webtool at https://engage.nrel.gov/.
