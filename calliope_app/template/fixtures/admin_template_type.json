            "description": "A binary cycle (ORC) geothermal power plant is a type of geothermal power plant that generates electricity by using heat from the Earth's subsurface to produce steam, which is then used to generate electricity through a turbine and generator. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is commonly accepted as a viable technology to convert from low to medium-temperature geothermal energy into electrical energy. These plants use geothermal fluids with a lower temperature range of around 100-200°C, which is too low to generate steam but can still be used to generate electricity."
