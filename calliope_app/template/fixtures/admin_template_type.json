The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is commonly accepted as a viable technology to convert from low to medium-temperature geothermal energy into electrical energy. These plants use geothermal fluids with a lower temperature range of around 100-180\u00b0C, which is too low to generate steam but can still be used to generate electricity."
