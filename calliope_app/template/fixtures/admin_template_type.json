            "description": "A binary cycle (ORC) geothermal power plant is a type of geothermal power plant that generates electricity by using heat from the Earth's subsurface to produce steam, which is then used to generate electricity through a turbine and generator. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is commonly accepted as a viable technology to convert from low to medium-temperature geothermal energy into electrical energy. These plants use geothermal fluids with a lower temperature range of around 100-200Â°C, which is too low to generate steam but can still be used to generate electricity."

            "description": "This node group consists of * a water source for water flowing in from a catchment area * another supply for discharge water coming in from sewage discharge * a storage element representing a reservoir above the hydroelectric dam * a conversion technology that consumes water from the reservoir to generate electricity. * and a demand element to represent water drawn from the reservoir. The modeler should provide time-series data for the water sources (water supplies) And water draw (water demand). The template will translate the head height and other inputs into configurations for the efficiency of the conversion technology. The modeler should remember that if multiple dams and reservoirs are consolidated into this single simple representation. Capacity expansion cannot be performed, because each storage and generation resource is different. The modeler should create electric transmission as appropriate to interconnect the dam turbine generator location to the electric grid in the model appropriately."
